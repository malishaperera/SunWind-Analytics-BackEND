# SunWind Analytics – Backend Service

SunWind Analytics is a **production-grade backend service** designed for a solar energy monitoring, analytics, and billing platform.  
It provides secure, scalable APIs for energy data processing, automated billing, Stripe-based payments, anomaly detection, and weather-aware analytics.

The system is built using **TypeScript** and follows **Clean Architecture principles** to ensure long-term maintainability, testability, and clear separation of concerns.

## 🎯 Backend Responsibilities

This service is responsible for:

- Synchronizing solar energy generation data
- Managing users and solar units
- Performing energy analytics
- Generating and managing invoices
- Processing payments via Stripe
- Detecting anomalies in energy production
- Providing weather context for solar performance
- Securing APIs with authentication and authorization
- Running automated background processes

## 🧪 Technology Stack

### Core
- **Node.js**
- **TypeScript**
- **Express.js**

### Database
- **MongoDB**
- **Mongoose**

### Authentication & Security
- **Clerk** (JWT-based authentication)
- Role-based access control

### Payments & Billing
- **Stripe Embedded Checkout**
- **Stripe Webhooks** (server-verified payment confirmation)

### External Integrations
- **Open-Meteo API** – weather data
- **Self-Hosted Data API** – energy generation records

### Background Processing
- **Cron-based schedulers**
- Automated invoice generation
- Periodic data synchronization
- Anomaly detection jobs

### Hosting
- **Render** (Backend services)

## 🗄️ Database Design

The backend uses **MongoDB** with a schema optimized for time-series data and billing accuracy.

### Core Collections

- **Users**
    - Application users mapped to authentication provider
- **SolarUnits**
    - Installed solar systems
- **EnergyGenerationRecords**
    - Time-series energy production data
- **Invoices**
    - Monthly billing records with payment state
- **Anomalies**
    - Detected irregular energy patterns

Each collection is designed to support **analytics, billing, and historical analysis** efficiently.

## 🔁 Background Jobs & Automation

The backend runs scheduled jobs to automate operational workflows.

### Energy Data Synchronization
- Pulls generation data from the Data API
- Normalizes and stores records
- Ensures consistent time-series data

### Invoice Generation
- Automatically generates monthly invoices
- Billing cycles anchored to installation date
- Calculates energy usage per billing period

### Anomaly Detection
- Analyzes historical energy data
- Detects sudden drops, prolonged low output, and abnormal spikes
- Stores anomalies with severity and resolution state

---

## 💳 Billing & Payment Flow

1. Monthly invoice is generated automatically
2. User initiates payment from the frontend
3. Backend creates a Stripe Checkout Session
4. Stripe handles secure payment processing
5. Stripe Webhook notifies backend of payment result
6. Invoice status is updated in the database

✔️ Payment state is **never trusted from the frontend**  
✔️ Stripe webhooks are the single source of truth

---

## 🔐 API Security Model

- Token-based authentication using Clerk
- Protected routes require valid JWT
- Users can only access their own resources
- Admin-level endpoints are role restricted
